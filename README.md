# Wandering Pets (Reforged)

**Wandering Pets (Reforged)** is a fork of the original Minecraft 1.16 Forge mod, updated for **Minecraft 1.21+ using NeoForge** and including a few tweaks and fixes.

This mod allows players to toggle the behavior of tamable mobs — such as cats, wolves, and parrots — between **following** and **wandering**, so they don't just sit down when not following the player.

## Features

- Bugfixes, compatibilty enhancements and reimplemented for NeoForge 1.21+
- Shift-right-click to toggle between follow and wander states
- Better cat behavior: cats alternate between sitting, sleeping, and roaming
- Mod compatibility: automatically extends support to modded entities that use vanilla behavior (i.e. FollowOwnerGoal)

## Configuration

- Edit `wanderingpets-common.toml` in `config` tweak mod settings
- The mod will automatically search for possibly compatible mod added entities on game load
